        <h1><b>A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS: Learn it faster. Remember it longer – by Mark Myers</b></h1>
        <h2>Book Id: 001</h2>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3 style="color:Tomato;"><b>Author: Mark Myers</b></h3>

        <p>In <b>“A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS: Learn it faster. Remember it longer”</b>, Mark Myers takes the
            learning
            process a notch higher by including interactive exercises.</p>
        <p>Instead of just reading about HTML/CSS, you also get to practice everything online.</p>

        <p>Sounds confusing?</p>
        <p>Okay, this is how it works</p>
        <p>At the end of every chapter, the book directs you to a practice site where you’ll find questions in the form
            of
            interactive exercises.</p>
        <p>You’re supposed to answer everything correctly before proceeding.</p>
        <p>And in case you enter an incorrect answer, the system will redirect you to the question until you get it
            right.
