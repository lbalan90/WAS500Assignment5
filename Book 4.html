        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3 style="color:Tomato;"><b>Author: Vicki L. Cox and Elizabeth Eisner Reding</b></h3>
        <p>The exercises within each unit have you build 5 different Web sites, which you add to/modify as you work
            through
            the book.</p>
        <p>This method helps reinforce memorization of the various HTML tags one needs to learn in order to develop a
            basic
            site.</p>
        <p>Although the text is comprehensive in introducing you to the various tags, the steps outlined in the
            exercises
            are confusing in how they are presented which makes it hard to follow along.</p>
        <p>The content could have been more streamlined and the steps broken out in a more reader-friendly manner.</p>
